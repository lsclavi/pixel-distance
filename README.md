# Pixel Distance


#### I created tool to measure distance between two different points on a digital map.  All that is needed is a sample distance.

#### Step 1:
##### Choose two points on a picture and determine what the distance is between the two points, whether made up or real.

#### Step 2:
##### Place your determined distance in the designated field, then take the distance of pixels between the two points and enter it in the designated field.

### Notes
#### For the time being, I have defaulted it to 60 miles per 128 pixels.
