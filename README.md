# Pixel Distance


#### I created tool to measure distance between two different points on a digital map.  All that is needed is a sample distance.

#### Choose two points on a picture and determine what the distance is between the two points, whether made up or real.

#### Place your determined distance in the designated field, then take the distance of pixels between the two points and enter it in the designated field.

#### For the time being, I have defaulted it to 60 miles per 128 pixels.

##### This is still in development.
